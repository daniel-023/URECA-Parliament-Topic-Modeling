## Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Singapore's parliamentary debates between 1965 and 1976. Using BERTopic, we uncover topics and trends in the legislative priorities of early Singapore, contributing to a deeper understanding of the political and policy landscape during this period.

## Key Features
* **Topic Modeling:** Using BERTopic to extract topics from historical parliamentary data.
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts such as intertopic distance maps, word clouds, and document clusters.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis of the parliamentary reports from three early parliaments of Singapore.
* **Interactive App:** Access the Streamlit app to visualize and explore the data interactively.


## Data Preview
| **parliament**  | **sitting_date** | **title** | **MPs_speaking** | **main_text** | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 24/1/1968 | REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS FUND BILL | Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour); Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister); Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi; Mr Bernard Rodrigues; Mr Ho See Beng; Mr P. Govindaswamy; Mr P. Selvadurai; Mr Teong Eng Siong; Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker); | Hon. Members are already aware that the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore will render a large number of workers unemployed. The House has just heard a statement by the Prime Minister that the British have again notified us that they will further cut short their stay and that they will be completely out by the end of 1971. |

Selvadurai asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education if he will enlighten this House as to how Mr Tan Wah Piow, who had absconded  before reporting for National Service, managed to enter Britain; whether Mr Tan had valid travel documents. and if so, how were they acquired, if not, how was he allowed entry into Britain in June. 1976; and what action, if any, the Government intends to take against Mr Tan. |
